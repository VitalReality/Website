			<h1>A bit about us</h1>
			<p>We are a team that is committed to making great games. We love talking about them, thinking about them, and of course, playing them. We want each new Vital team member to share our passion for creating great, compelling games. Does this sound like you?</p>
			<p>Our process is highly collaborative and we value each other’s voices. Everyone is encouraged to contribute their opinions, discoveries and interpretations; in their own field as well as others. If you value conviction, speaking honestly, and sharing your personal perspective - you’ll fit right in.</p>
			<p>From this collaborative environment, each person is empowered to take ideas and shape them, evolve them, and make them their own. We’re looking for people who enjoy a high level of ownership and thrive in this setting.</p>
