					<h2 class="name">Roberto Rodriguez</h2>
					<h2 class="separator">&ndash;</h2>
					<h2 class="title">CTO</h3>
					<p class="bio">Pinpointing Roberto's exact origins is difficult as carbon-dating technology just isn't able to go back that far in time yet. What we do know is that after working on a long list of games, from Spyro to Ratchet & Clank to Call of Duty and many more, he decided to establish Vital and assemble a new team. At first it seemed like he only communicated through a complex mix of sarcasm and dance, but after a break-through in understanding using a robot-with-a-heart as a translator, his prowess in the technical arts became very clear. Roberto has taken up the mantle of CTO in charge of the technical direction at Vital. He is also, by all accounts, a pretty good dad.</p>

					<h2 class="name">Ronn LeFeuvre</h2>
					<h2 class="separator">&ndash;</h2>
					<h2 class="title">Design Director</h3>
					<p class="bio">Ronn started creating games at age 10, trying to sell (or at least give away) his creations to the neighborhood kids. Since then, he’s been a part of teams of all scales—from indie to AAA. He’s worked on games from some of the biggest franchises in the industry, including Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. His career has taken him from being a gameplay programmer to his current role as design director at Vital. Ronn fills his non-development hours with board games, eating breakfast for each meal of the day, and occasional lock-picking.</p>

					<h2 class="name">Stephen Ratter</h2>
					<h2 class="separator">&ndash;</h2>
					<h2 class="title">Art Director</h2>
					<p class="bio">For more than 25 years, Stephen has been creating environment art and contributing to design for 16 shipped games including the original Medal of Honor trilogy, Call of Duty: Finest Hour (the first in the landmark franchise), the Resistance trilogy, Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time, and Here They Lie. Now joining his seasoned pals at Vital, Stephen is stepping into the role of art director, eager to shape the team's aesthetic presentation and craft fresh and intriguing visuals. He continues his career-long pursuit  of how lush, environmental storytelling reinforces the potency of a game's internal narrative. Mr. Ratter's choices (both conscious and irrational) are aided and abetted by his preoccupations with beekeeping, board games, backpacking, weird fiction, the desert, and 30 years of DJing a weekly radio show.</p>

					<p class="bio">John's been working in the games industry for the last six years on projects that include God of War (2018), Here they Lie, Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and several unannounced titles. As a self-taught programmer with a passion for exploring new technology, he’s thrilled to be building an engine for the next generation of XR experiences. In his spare time, you might find John plodding through a new RPG, curled up with a kindle, or soaring through the air in a paraglider.</p>

					<h2 class="name">John Harries</h2>
					<h2 class="separator">&ndash;</h2>
					<h2 class="title">Engineering Philosopher</h2>
					<p class="bio">John has been developing award-winning video games and cutting-edge game engine technology for over three decades. His first games were on the Commodore 64 and since then has been a large part of development for the Call of Duty, Deus Ex, Thief, Sims, Transformers, True Crime, Kung Fu Panda, Fallout, and XCOM franchises, among many others. At Vital, John creates brand new gaming technology and cutting edge puns. When not in front of a computer, John is usually found at metal shows or showing victims pictures of his grandchildren.</p>

					<h2 class="name">Rogelio Espinoza</h2>
					<h2 class="separator">&ndash;</h2>
					<h2 class="title">Software Engineer</h2>
					<p class="bio">Rogelio feels weird about writing in third person, but also succumbs easily to peer pressure. While he was always flirting with the idea of making games—specifically spending most of his life dreaming up fighting games—he really only started dipping his toes in the game industry in 2012, working at Club Lia (an educational games studio.) After five years, he was determined to join the big leagues and went to UCSC to get his master’s degree in games and playable media (Yes, it’s real. Google it). After a few odd and exciting jobs here and there, he joined Vital as a software engineer where he delightfully enjoys his position as permanent design support and experimenting with new tech. When not in front of a computer… wait, no nevermind, he seems incapable of surviving without being nearby a screen.</p>

					<h2 class="name">Ricardo Tobon</h2>
					<h2 class="separator">&ndash;</h2>
					<h2 class="title">Animation Director</h2>
					<p class="bio">Ricardo has helped push the boundaries of performance and storytelling in visual effects, games and animation at studios that include Sony Computer Entertainment, Digital Domain, Weta Digital, and DreamWorks Animation. He is the author of the best seller “The Mocap Book” and has given lectures on the subject at universities, film festivals and international conferences. His extensive list of credits span from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to Uncharted 3 and beyond. Ricardo has been an advocate of integrating traditional animation techniques with cutting edge technology and is excited about bringing such methods into Vital Game Studios.</p>

					<h2 class="name">Mike Urda</h2>
					<h2 class="separator">&ndash;</h2>
					<h2 class="title">Senior Programmer</h2>
					<p class="bio">Hailing from the alternating snowy tundra and humid bog of Chicago, Mike has been making games in a variety of capacities for a mere decade and change. He got his start on a little gem called Fracture as a QA analyst, proceeded to help out on F3AR’s multiplayer modes as a Tech Designer, pivoted to an Associate Producer on a cancelled title before being summoned to California to work on God of War: Ascension and God of War (2018) as a build engineer/programmer. Mike spends his day discussing anything he can with his very bright coworkers, writing code that is ideally readable and functional (admittedly less than he would like), and brainstorming ways to streamline things. Exercise, Overwatch, League of Legends, social events of all types, and surprisingly reading are Mike’s preferred leisure activities.</p>
